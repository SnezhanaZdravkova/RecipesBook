# WELCOME TO HEALTHY RECIPES SITE
This is a full-stack framework project built using Django, Python, HTML and CSS. My goal is to create a functioning and responsive website, that allows users to post, comment and like or unlike recipes. This project has been built for educational purposes.

## User Experience

A visitor to Healthy Recipes would be someone who is most likely an adult who enjoys their food and trying new recipes but also wants to save time and effort when deciding what to cook every day of the week.

## User Stories

### User Profile
- As a Site User I can register an account so that I can add/edit/delete my recipes and comment on and like other people's recipes.
- As a Site User, I can log in or log out of my account so that I can keep my account secure.
- As a Site User I can see my login status so that I know if I'm logged in or out.
